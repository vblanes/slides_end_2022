	abstract = {The present study analyzes the prevalence of overweight/obesity in a sample of young adults from the University of the Basque Country (Spain), and tests the efficiency of the silhouettes to predict overweight/obesity. This cross-sectional study was conducted in a sample of volunteer university students from the University of the Basque Country (356 men and 745 women, age: 18–33 years), who came to the Physical Anthropology laboratory where a standardized questionnaire was administered and anthropometric measurements were taken by a well-trained anthropometrist. Height and weight were obtained. BMI was calculated as weight/height2 (kg/m2) and it was used as a reference method. Using a questionnaire, based on the standard figural stimuli, subjects were asked to choose the silhouette which was closest to his/her usual appearance (current body size). The accuracy of the Williamson et al.'s silhouettes as an overweight-obesity indicator was analyzed by gender-specific receiver operating curve (ROC). The cutoff figure to distinguish between nonoverweight and overweight-obese individuals corresponded to number 7 in men and 6 in women. These cutoff values matched optimal sensitivity and specificity, with few nonoverweight subjects selecting silhouettes bigger than 7 in the case of men or 6 for women. In conclusion, the figural stimuli allows the identification of populations at overweight/obesity risk with the simple use of silhouettes, at least in this rank of age, where the overweight and obesity are yet little frequent.},

Hence we investigate the incorporation of non-linear interactions to help improve accuracy of prediction; by comparing the result of logistic regression with those of six mature data mining techniques.The contributions of this paper are as follows: a) a comparison of logistic regression with six data mining techniques: specifically, for the prediction of overweight and obese children at 3 years using data recorded at birth, 6 weeks, 8 months and 2 years respectively; b) improved accuracy of prediction: prediction at 8 months accuracy is improved very slightly, in this case by using neural networks, whereas for prediction at 2 years obtained accuracy is improved by over 10\%, in this case by using Bayesian methods. It has also been shown that incorporation of non-linear interactions could be important in epidemiological prediction, and that data mining techniques are becoming sufficiently well established to offer the medical research community a valid alternative to logistic regression.},

Objectives: to design a FFQ based on enhancers and inhibitors of iron absorption and to assess its applicability in a group of women at childbearing age.
Methods: the FFQ included 28 items and the time of consumption for 10 of them, breakfast (B) and lunch/dinner (LD). One hundred and seventy nine healthy young women were selected and distributed into three groups according to their iron status measured by serum ferritin: {\textless} 15, 15-30 or {\textgreater} 30 ng/mL.
Results: the reproducibility of this FFQ was very high (Spearman coefficient {\textgreater} 0.500, p {\textless} 0.001 for all variables). Red meat and alcoholic beverages consumption was positively associated with ferritin, while citric fruitsLD and nuts-LD were negatively associated (p {\textless} 0.05). Citric fruits-LD was negatively associated with red meat (p {\textless} 0.05) and positively with legumes, fish, salad, vegetables, foods fortified with fiber, other fruits (p {\textless} 0.001) and brown bread (p {\textless} 0.05). The consumption of fruit juices with breakfast was lower in women with ferritin {\textless}15 ng/ml compared to ferritin 15-30 ng/ml.
Conclusion: this questionnaire is simple and reproducible. Red meat is the main dietary factor related with higher iron status in young women, thus its influence on iron absorption compared to other enhancers and inhibitors is highlighted.},

	abstract = {Aim. This paper considers the challenges of delivering effective palliative care to older people with dementia and the possible strategies to overcome barriers to end-of-life care in these patients. Background. In UK alone, approximately 100 000 people with dementia die each year and as the number of older people increases, dementia is set to become even more prevalent. Dementia is a progressive terminal illness for which there is currently no cure. Patients dying with dementia have significant health-care needs and in recent years it has been recognised that palliative care should be made available to everyone regardless of diagnosis, as this improves comfort and quality of life. Despite this, patients dying with dementia are often still not given access to palliative care services. Method. A review of English language literature published after 1996 to the present day relating to older people with dementia during the terminal phase of their illness. Results. Twenty-nine articles met inclusion criteria for the review. Most originated from North America and UK and were mostly quantitative in nature. Four key themes were identified: difficulties associated with diagnosing the terminal phase of the illness (prognostication); issues relating to communication; medical interventions; and the appropriateness of palliative care intervention. Conclusions. This review reinforces the importance of providing appropriate palliative care to individuals suffering from end-stage dementia and identifies some of the barriers to extending such specialist palliative care provision. Relevance to practice. There is an urgent need to improve palliative care provision for older people with end-stage dementia and, in addition, more research is required on the needs of patients entering the terminal phase of dementia to assist the allocation of appropriate resources and training to ensure quality and equality in the provision of end-of-life care.},

	abstract = {Background
Historically, palliative care has been focused on those with cancer. Although these ties persist, palliative care is rapidly integrating into the care of patients with common, non-cancer serious illnesses. Despite this, the bulk of literature informing palliative care practices stems from the care of cancer patients.
Objectives
We compared functionality, advanced care planning, hospital admissions, prognosis, quality of life, pain, dyspnea, fatigue, and depression between patients with cancer and three non-cancer diagnoses—end-stage renal disease (ESRD), heart failure (HF), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
Methods
We conducted a cross-sectional, retrospective analysis of the characteristics and symptoms of patient's with ESRD, HF, COPD, and cancer at time of first specialty palliative care referral. Using a web-based point of care quality assessment and reporting tool, Quality Data and Collection Tool-Palliative care, this analysis evaluated all eligible patients who received a palliative care consultation between October 1, 2012 and November 25, 2014. Data were obtained from 13 participating sites. The primary outcome for the study was functionality using the palliative performance scale. Hospital admission in the last 30 days, prognosis, patient's understanding of prognosis, advanced care planning including code status and appointed decision maker, pain, fatigue, depression, and dyspnea were also evaluated as secondary outcomes. We tested for an association between our outcomes with disease type (cancer vs. non-cancer) fitting multivariable logistic regression models.
Results
We found that the patients with primary diagnoses other than cancer were less functional at time of referral (odds ratio: 1.6; 95\% CI: 1.1, 2.3; P {\textless} 0.05).
Conclusion
Patients with COPD, ESRD, and HF were less functional and more likely to be hospitalized at time of referral to palliative care than cancer patients. These findings may be reflective of the slower and more varied trajectory of non-cancer serious illness. One aim of palliative care for those with non-cancer severe illness should be directed toward improving and assisting with functionality and decreasing frequency of hospital admissions. These interventions could take place in the palliative care office, but could also be integrated into hospital discharge plans.},

	abstract = {Background and objectives: Dialysis patients are increasingly characterized by older age, multiple comorbidities, and shortened life expectancy. This study investigated whether the “surprise” question, “Would I be surprised if this patient died in the next year?” identifies patients who are at high risk for early mortality.
Design, setting, participants, \& measurements: This prospective cohort study of 147 patients in three hemodialysis dialysis units classified patients into “yes” and “no” groups on the basis of the “surprise” question response and tracked patient status (alive or dead) at 12 mo. Demographics, Charlson Comorbidity Index score, and Karnofsky Performance Status score were measured.
Results: Initially, 34 (23\%) patients were classified in the “no” group. Compared with the 113 patients in the “yes” group, the patients in the “no” group were older (72.5 ± 12.8 versus 64.5 ± 14.9), had a higher comorbidity score (7.1 ± 2.3 versus 5.8 ± 2.1), and had a lower performance status score (69.7 ± 17.1 versus 81.6 ± 15.8). At 12 mo, 22 (15\%) patients had died; the mortality rate for the “no” group was 29.4\% and for the “yes” group was 10.6\%. The odds of dying within 1 yr for the patients in the “no” group were 3.5 times higher than for patients in the “yes” group, (odds ratio 3.507, 95\% CI 1.356 to 9.067, P = 0.01).
Conclusions: The “surprise” question is effective in identifying sicker dialysis patients who have a high risk for early mortality and should receive priority for palliative care interventions.},

It maps the nodes of a dataﬂow graph across many machines in a cluster, and within a machine across multiple computational devices, including multicore CPUs, generalpurpose GPUs, and custom-designed ASICs known as Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). This architecture gives ﬂexibility to the application developer: whereas in previous “parameter server” designs the management of shared state is built into the system, TensorFlow enables developers to experiment with novel optimizations and training algorithms. TensorFlow supports a variety of applications, with a focus on training and inference on deep neural networks. Several Google services use TensorFlow in production, we have released it as an open-source project, and it has become widely used for machine learning research. In this paper, we describe the TensorFlow dataﬂow model and demonstrate the compelling performance that TensorFlow achieves for several real-world applications.},

The learning procedures must be capable of modifying the connection strengths in such a way that internal units that are not part of the input or output come to represent important features of the task domain. Several interesting gradient-descent procedures have recently been discovered. Each connection computes the derivative, with respect to the connection strength, of a global measure of the error in the performance of the network. The strength is then adjusted in the direction that decreases the error. These relatively simple, gradient-descent learning procedures work well for small tasks, and the new challenge is to find ways of improving their convergence rate and their generalization abilities so that they can be applied to larger, more realistic tasks.},

In this paper we show that even high-order polynomial classifiers in high dimensional spaces can be trained with a small amount of training data and yet generalize better than classifiers with a smaller VC-dimension. This is achieved with a maximum margin algorithm (the Generalized Portrait). The technique is applicable to a wide variety of classifiers, including Perceptrons, polynomial classifiers (sigma-pi unit networks) and Radial Basis Functions. The effective number of parameters is adjusted automatically by the training algorithm to match the complexity of the problem. It is shown to equal the number of those training patterns which are closest patterns to the decision boundary (supporting patterns). Bounds on the generalization error and the speed of convergence of the algorithm are given. Experimental results on handwritten digit recognition demonstrate good generalization compared to other algorithms.},

The EHR data of admitted patients are automatically evaluated by an algorithm, which brings patients who are likely to benefit from palliative care services to the attention of the Palliative Care team. The algorithm is a Deep Neural Network trained on the EHR data from previous years, to predict all-cause 3-12 month mortality of patients as a proxy for patients that could benefit from palliative care. Our predictions enable the Palliative Care team to take a proactive approach in reaching out to such patients, rather than relying on referrals from treating physicians, or conduct time consuming chart reviews of all patients. We also present a novel interpretation technique which we use to provide explanations of the model's predictions.},

	abstract = {Summary
Background
Patients with advanced cancer have reduced quality of life, which tends to worsen towards the end of life. We assessed the effect of early palliative care in patients with advanced cancer on several aspects of quality of life.
Methods
The study took place at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre (Toronto, ON, Canada), between Dec 1, 2006, and Feb 28, 2011. 24 medical oncology clinics were cluster randomised (in a 1:1 ratio, using a computer-generated sequence, stratified by clinic size and tumour site [four lung, eight gastrointestinal, four genitourinary, six breast, two gynaecological]), to consultation and follow-up (at least monthly) by a palliative care team or to standard cancer care. Complete masking of interventions was not possible; however, patients provided written informed consent to participate in their own study group, without being informed of the existence of another group. Eligible patients had advanced cancer, European Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0–2, and a clinical prognosis of 6–24 months. Quality of life (Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy—Spiritual Well-Being [FACIT-Sp] scale and Quality of Life at the End of Life [QUAL-E] scale), symptom severity (Edmonton Symptom Assessment System [ESAS]), satisfaction with care (FAMCARE-P16), and problems with medical interactions (Cancer Rehabilitation Evaluation System Medical Interaction Subscale [CARES-MIS]) were measured at baseline and monthly for 4 months. The primary outcome was change score for FACIT-Sp at 3 months. Secondary endpoints included change score for FACIT-Sp at 4 months and change scores for other scales at 3 and 4 months. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01248624.
Findings
461 patients completed baseline measures (228 intervention, 233 control); 393 completed at least one follow-up assessment. At 3-months, there was a non-significant difference in change score for FACIT-Sp between intervention and control groups (3·56 points [95\% CI −0·27 to 7·40], p=0·07), a significant difference in QUAL-E (2·25 [0·01 to 4·49], p=0·05) and FAMCARE-P16 (3·79 [1·74 to 5·85], p=0·0003), and no difference in ESAS (−1·70 [−5·26 to 1·87], p=0·33) or CARES-MIS (−0·66 [−2·25 to 0·94], p=0·40). At 4 months, there were significant differences in change scores for all outcomes except CARES-MIS. All differences favoured the intervention group.
Interpretation
Although the difference in quality of life was non-significant at the primary endpoint, this trial shows promising findings that support early palliative care for patients with advanced cancer.

	abstract = {Purpose
Randomized controlled trials have supported integrated oncology and palliative care (PC); however, optimal timing has not been evaluated. We investigated the effect of early versus delayed PC on quality of life (QOL), symptom impact, mood, 1-year survival, and resource use.

Patients and Methods
Between October 2010 and March 2013, 207 patients with advanced cancer at a National Cancer Institute cancer center, a Veterans Affairs Medical Center, and community outreach clinics were randomly assigned to receive an in-person PC consultation, structured PC telehealth nurse coaching sessions (once per week for six sessions), and monthly follow-up either early after enrollment or 3 months later. Outcomes were QOL, symptom impact, mood, 1-year survival, and resource use (hospital/intensive care unit days, emergency room visits, chemotherapy in last 14 days, and death location).

Results
Overall patient-reported outcomes were not statistically significant after enrollment (QOL, P = .34; symptom impact, P = .09; mood, P = .33) or before death (QOL, P = .73; symptom impact, P = .30; mood, P = .82). Kaplan-Meier 1-year survival rates were 63\% in the early group and 48\% in the delayed group (difference, 15\%; P = .038). Relative rates of early to delayed decedents' resource use were similar for hospital days (0.73; 95\% CI, 0.41 to 1.27; P = .26), intensive care unit days (0.68; 95\% CI, 0.23 to 2.02; P = .49), emergency room visits (0.73; 95\% CI, 0.45 to 1.19; P = .21), chemotherapy in last 14 days (1.57; 95\% CI, 0.37 to 6.7; P = .27), and home death (27 [54\%] v 28 [47\%]; P = .60).

Conclusion
Early-entry participants' patient-reported outcomes and resource use were not statistically different; however, their survival 1-year after enrollment was improved compared with those who began 3 months later. Understanding the complex mechanisms whereby PC may improve survival remains an important research priority.},

Methods: We used administrative data for all nonpsychiatric admissions of adult patients to hospitals in the provinces of Ontario (2003–2010) and Alberta (2011–2012), and to the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston (2010–2012) to calculate each patient's HOMR score at admission. The HOMR score is based on a set of parameters that captures patient demographics, health burden and severity of acute illness. We determined patient status (alive or dead) 1 year after admission using population-based registries.
Results: The 3 validation cohorts (n = 2 862 996 in Ontario, 210 595 in Alberta and 66 683 in Boston) were distinct from each other and from the derivation cohort. The overall risk of death within 1 year after admission was 8.7\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] 8.7\% to 8.8\%). The HOMR score was strongly and significantly associated with risk of death in all populations and was highly discriminative, with a C statistic ranging from 0.89 (95\% CI 0.87 to 0.91) to 0.92 (95\% CI 0.91 to 0.92). Observed and expected outcome risks were similar (median absolute difference in percent dying in 1 yr 0.3\%, interquartile range 0.05\%–2.5\%).
Interpretation: The HOMR score, calculated using routinely collected administrative data, accurately predicted the risk of death among adult patients within 1 year after admission to hospital for nonpsychiatric indications. Similar performance was seen when the score was used in geographically and temporally diverse populations. The HOMR model can be used for risk adjustment in analyses of health administrative data to predict long-term survival among hospital patients.},

This rule is independent of the underlying joint distribution on the sample points and their classifications, and hence the probability of errorRof such a rule must be at least as great as the Bayes probability of errorR{\textasciicircum}ast–the minimum probability of error over all decision rules taking underlying probability structure into account. However, in a large sample analysis, we will show in theM-category case thatR{\textasciicircum}ast leq R leq R{\textasciicircum}ast(2 –MR{\textasciicircum}ast/(M-1)), where these bounds are the tightest possible, for all suitably smooth underlying distributions. Thus for any number of categories, the probability of error of the nearest neighbor rule is bounded above by twice the Bayes probability of error. In this sense, it may be said that half the classification information in an infinite sample set is contained in the nearest neighbor.},

In this paper, we introduce the concept of tree-based pipeline optimization for automating one of the most tedious parts of machine learning—pipeline design. We implement a Tree-based Pipeline Optimization Tool (TPOT) and demonstrate its effectiveness on a series of simulated and real-world genetic data sets. In particular, we show that TPOT can build machine learning pipelines that achieve competitive classification accuracy and discover novel pipeline operators—such as synthetic feature constructors—that significantly improve classification accuracy on these data sets. We also highlight the current challenges to pipeline optimization, such as the tendency to produce pipelines that overfit the data, and suggest future research paths to overcome these challenges. As such, this work represents an early step toward fully automating machine learning pipeline design.},

	abstract = {Background
There is a concern about the accuracy of the available prognostic indexes when applying them to the emergent population of polypathological patients (PP).
Methods
To develop a 1-year mortality predictive index on PP, we developed a multicenter prospective cohort-study recruiting 1.632 PP after hospital discharge, outpatient clinics, or home hospitalization, from 33 hospitals. Potential risk factors were obtained in the 1.525 PP who completed follow-up. Each factor independently associated with mortality in the derivation cohort (757 PP from western hospitals) was assigned a weight, and risk scores were calculated by adding the points of each factor. Accuracy was assessed in the validation cohort (768 PP from eastern hospitals) by risk quartiles calibration, and discrimination power, by ROC curves. Finally, accuracy of the index was compared with that of the Charlson index.
Results
Mortality in the derivation/validation cohorts was 35\%/39.5\%, respectively. Nine independent mortality predictors were identified to create the index (age ≥85years, 3points; No caregiver or caregiver other than spouse, 2points; active neoplasia, 6points; dementia, 3points; III–IV functional class on NYHA and/or MRC, 3points; delirium during last hospital admission, 3points; hemoglobinemia {\textless}10g/dl, 3points; Barthel index {\textless}60 points, 4points; ≥4 hospital admissions in last 12months, 3points). Mortality in the derivation/validation cohorts was 12.1\%/14.6\% for patients with 0–2points; 21.5\%/31.5\% for those with 3–6 points; 45\%/50\% for those with 7–10 points; and 68\%/61.3\% for those with ≥11points, respectively. Calibration was good in derivation/validation cohorts, and discrimination power by area under the curve was 0.77/0.7. Calibration of the Charlson index was good, but discrimination power was suboptimal (area under the curve, 0.59).
Conclusions
This prognostic index provides an accurate and transportable method of stratifying 1-year death risk in PP.},

	abstract = {BackgroundThe process of prognostication has not been described for acutely hospitalized older patients.ObjectiveTo investigate (1) which factors are associated with 90-day mortality risk in a group of acutely hospitalized older medical patients, and (2) whether adding a clinical impression score of nurses or physicians improves the discriminatory ability of mortality prediction.DesignProspective cohort study.ParticipantsFour hundred and sixty-three medical patients 65 years or older acutely admitted from November 1, 2002, through July 1, 2005, to a 1024-bed tertiary university teaching hospital.MeasurementsAt admission, the attending nurse and physician were asked to give a clinical impression score for the illness the patient was admitted for. This score ranged from 1 (high possibility of a good outcome) until 10 (high possibility of a bad outcome, including mortality). Of all patients baseline characteristics and clinical parameters were collected. Mortality was registered up to 90 days after admission.Main ResultsIn total, 23.8\% (n = 110) of patients died within 90 days of admission. Four parameters were significantly associated with mortality risk: functional impairment, diagnosis malignancy, co-morbidities and high urea nitrogen serum levels. The AUC for the baseline model which included these risk factors (model 1) was 0.76 (95\% CI 0.71 to 0.82). The AUC for the model using the risk factors and the clinical impression score of the physician (model 2) was 0.77 (0.71 to 0.82). The AUC for the model using the risk factors and the clinical impression score of the nurse (model 3) was 0.76 (0.71 to 0.82) and the AUC for the model, including the baseline covariates and the clinical impression score of both nurses and physicians was 0.77 (0.72 to 0.82). Adding clinical impression scores to model 1 did not significantly improve its accuracy.ConclusionA set of four clinical variables predicted mortality risk in acutely hospitalized older patients quite well. Adding clinical impression scores of nurses, physicians or both did not improve the discriminating ability of the model.},
